Found this scrounging around looking for attack surface tools, but added a lot and re-wrote. 


This Go script takes a top level domain and scrapes, searches for subdomains then runs a couple of different nmap scans on the TLD and all subdomains and saves a report in XML and HTML. The script always requires a bit of XML parsing adjusting, but it does work!
